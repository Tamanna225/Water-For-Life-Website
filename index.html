			<h2>Welcome to our Water Conservation Website</h2>
			<b><p style="color: black">Water is a precious resource that we need to conserve to ensure its availability for future generations. There are many aspects of daily living that have the power to impact the environment negatively. When taking into account every household, business and service, these factors then have the power to increase environmental damage on a momentous, global scale. Water waste is just one example of a damaging environmental factor, but it's an extremely significant one. It's very important for individuals, households and businesses alike to understand the impact of water waste on the environment so that the world at large can work to a more sustainable future. Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage. According to Fresh Water Watch, water conservation is important because fresh clean water is a limited resource, as well as a costly one. As a homeowner, you’re probably already well aware of the financial costs of inefficient water use. Conservation of this natural resource is critical for the environment — and our wallets. This website will provide you insight about water wastage and water conservation techniques. Our website provides tips and information on how you can help conserve water and why it's important.</p>
